    @UserMessage("""
            Your task is to detect whether a fraud was committed for the customer {{name}} {{surname}}.

            To detect a fraud, perform the following actions:
            1 - Retrieve all bookings for the customer with name {{name}} and surname {{surname}}.
            2 - If there are no bookings, return the fraud status as 'false'.
            3 - Otherwise, Determine if there is an overlap between several bookings.
            4 - If there is an overlap, a fraud is detected.
            5 - If a fraud is detected, return the fraud status and the bookings that overlap.

            A booking overlap (and hence a fraud) occurs when there are several bookings for a given date.
            For instance:
            -there is no overlap if a given customer has the following bookings:
                    - Booking number 345-678 with the period from 2024-03-25 to 2024-03-31.
                    - Booking number 234-567 with the period from 2024-03-21 to 2024-03-23.
            -there is an overlap if a given customer has the following bookings:
                    - Booking number 456-789 with the period from 2024-03-21 to 2024-03-31.
                    - Booking number 567-890 with the period from 2024-03-22 to 2024-03-27.

            Answer with the following information in a valid JSON document:
            - the customer-name key set to {{name}}
            - the customer-surname key set to {{surname}}
            - the fraud-detected key set to 'true' or 'false'
            - in case of fraud, the explanation of the fraud in the fraud-explanation key
            - in case of fraud, the reservation ids that overlap.
            You must respond in a valid JSON format.

            You must not wrap JSON response in backticks, markdown, or in any other way, but return it as plain text.
